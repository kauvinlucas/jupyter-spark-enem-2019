# Jupyter-Spark ENEM 2019
In this project I'll address some of the social and demographic aspects on the scores of the ENEM 2019, a standardized test used for admission in Brazilian colleges published in 2019. Spark was used for the ingestion steps; statistical analysis was performed with Pandas, Statsmodels and Scikit-learn; and visualizations were generated inside the notebook with the help of the Matplotlib, Seaborn and Folium libraries.

The notebook (written in Portuguese) of this project can be found [here](src/main.ipynb). Also, I wrote and published an english report about this project which can be found in this [link](http://kauvinlucas.com/projects/jupyter-spark-enem-2019/en.html). A simple HTML version (in Portuguese) of the report is called index.html in the root folder.
