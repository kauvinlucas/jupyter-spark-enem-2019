# Jupyter-Spark ENEM 2019
In this project I'll address some of the social and demographic aspects on the scores of the ENEM 2019, a standardized test used for admission in Brazilian colleges published in 2019. Visualizations were generated in Jupyter notebooks and data cleaning, Spark was used for ETL and Pandas for EDA analysis.

The notebooks of this project can be found here. Also, I wrote a article about this project that can be found in the following link:
