# Jupyter-Spark ENEM 2019
In this project I'll address some of the social and demographic aspects on the scores of the ENEM 2019, a standardized test used for admission in Brazilian colleges published in 2019. Spark was used for ETL steps; statistical analysis was performed with Pandas, Statsmodels and Scikit-learn; and visualizations were generated inside the notebook with the help of the Matplotlib, Seaborn and Folium libraries.

The notebooks of this project can be found here. Also, I wrote and published a report about this project which can be found in this [link](http://kauvinlucas.com/projects/jupyter-spark-enem-2019/en.html). A HTML version of the report can be found [here](assets/main.html).
