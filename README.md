# eda-enem-2021
In this project I'll address some of the concerns about the social and demographic aspects on the scores of the ENEM, a standardized test used for admission in Brazilian colleges published in 2021. Visualizations were generated in Jupyter notebooks and data cleaning, Spark was used for ETL and Pandas for EDA analysis.
